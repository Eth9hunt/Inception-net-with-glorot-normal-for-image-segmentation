# Inception-net-with-glorot-normal-for-image-segmentation
InceptionNet (v1) + Glorot init. for image segmentation: Use InceptionNet as an encoder, pre-trained with Glorot weights. Add a decoder network for segmentation masks. Train with labelled data. The encoder extracts features, the decoder generates masks. Newer Inception versions may perform better.

The InceptionNet architecture, specifically Inception v1, is a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that has been successfully applied to various computer vision tasks, including image classification. While it was primarily designed for image classification, it can also be adapted for image segmentation tasks.

Glorot normal initialization, also known as Xavier initialization, is a weight initialization technique commonly used in neural networks. It aims to set the initial weights of the network in a way that helps with efficient training and avoids the vanishing or exploding gradients problem.

To use InceptionNet with Glorot normal initialization for image segmentation, the architecture can be modified to include an additional decoder network that learns to generate pixel-level segmentation masks. This is often achieved through the use of skip connections to combine low-level and high-level features.

The general approach is as follows:

Encoder: The InceptionNet architecture, typically pre-trained on a large-scale image classification task, is the encoder. The pre-trained weights can be initialized with Glorot normal initialization.

Decoder: A decoder network is added to the InceptionNet architecture to generate pixel-level segmentation masks. This network usually consists of upsampling layers and skip connections to combine feature maps from different resolution levels.

Training: The entire network (encoder + decoder) is then trained using labelled training images and segmentation ground truth. The weights of both the encoder and decoder can be fine-tuned using backpropagation and an appropriate loss function such as cross-entropy or Dice loss.

By combining the InceptionNet architecture with a decoder network for segmentation and initializing the weights with Glorot normal initialization, the model can leverage the powerful feature extraction capabilities of InceptionNet while adapting it to the task of image segmentation.

It's worth noting that since the release of Inception v1, newer versions of the Inception architecture, such as Inception v2, v3, and Inception-ResNet, have been developed. These newer versions often incorporate additional improvements and can provide even better performance for image segmentation tasks.
