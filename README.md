# Inception-net-with-glorot-normal-for-image-segmentation
InceptionNet (v1) + Glorot init. for image segmentation: Use InceptionNet as encoder, pretrained with Glorot weights. Add decoder network for segmentation masks. Train with labeled data. Encoder extracts features, decoder generates masks. Newer Inception versions may perform better.
